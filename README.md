# Snake-Game
Grid Setup: The game is usually played on a grid, often a square grid, where the snake and food items move around.

Snake Movement: The snake starts with a single segment and moves continuously in a specific direction (up, down, left, or right). The player can control the direction of movement using arrow keys or other input methods.

Food Generation: Food items appear randomly on the grid. When the snake consumes a piece of food, it grows longer by adding a new segment to its body.

Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the snake and itself (if it runs into its own body) or with the boundaries of the grid (if it reaches the edge of the grid). Collisions result in the end of the game.

Scoring: Typically, the player earns points for each food item eaten. The score increases as the snake grows longer.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries. At this point, the player's score is displayed, and they may be given the option to play again.

Graphics and User Interface: While the core logic of the game is essential, a good implementation also includes graphics to represent the snake, food items, and grid, as well as a user interface for player interaction (start, pause, restart, etc.).
